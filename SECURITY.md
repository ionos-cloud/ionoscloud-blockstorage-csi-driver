## Reporting a Vulnerability

At IONOS Cloud, we take security seriously and value the contributions of security researchers and the broader community
to keep our systems secure. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability or issue within our provider, please
report it to us promptly. We appreciate your help in disclosing the issue responsibly.

To report a security issue, please [open a draft security
advisory](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/ionoscloud-blockstorage-csi-driver/security/advisories/new). We kindly request
that you do not disclose the issue publicly until we have had an opportunity to address it.

When reporting, please provide detailed information about the nature of the issue so that we can address it as quickly
as possible. We aim to respond to security vulnerability reports within two workdays and will keep you informed of our
progress.
